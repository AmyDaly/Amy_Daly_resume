<p>My Name is Amy and I am an aspiring Software Engineer. I started out my career
    as an Optometrist in 2012. I have an Optometry degree that I obtained at the University of Johannesburg, but I have
    always had an interest in Tech and decided to pursue this at the tender age of 34. I enrolled in the HyperionDev
    Software Engineering Bootcamp in July, and it has been an amazing learning experience. In the future I would love to
    work in an environment where I could use both my knowledge and skills from Optometry together with the skills I have
    learned in Software Development. I enjoy a good challenge and thrive on learning. On the personal side of things I
    enjoy the outdoors and spending time with my family.
</p>


<p>I have 11 years experience in Optometry, six of which I worked in a clinical
    environment within Ophthalmology. After having children of my own I developed a great interest in paediatric and
    behavioral optometry, and have since worked within this specialised area of optometry ensuring quality care for
    children and neuro-optometric patients. I would love to be able to bring resources to assist patients with their
    care through the implementation of Software.

            <li>2012 -2015</li>
            <li>I worked together with an ophthalmologist in a clinical setting, this position entailed patient
                pre-testing and pre-op work up. The ophthalmologist who I worked with specialised in retinal surgery and
                the posterior segment of the eye.</li>

    <li>Dr Stefano Guglielmetti at NHC in Northcliff

            <li>2015 - 2018</li>
            <li>During my time working with Dr Guglielmetti, I was exposed to anterior segment pathology. This gave me a
                greater understanding and insight into a different area of the eye and treatment options available. </li>
            <li>While working in ophthalmology I was also able to assist the University Clinics by supervising and
                supporting optometry students with their final year clinics. </li>

            <li>During my time working for Eyetek I was exposed to a completely new area in optometry, this ignited my
                interest into the behavioral side of optometry. Here we specialised in Paediatrics and Neuro-optometry,
                assisting patients with uncommon visual concerns, and learning difficulties.
